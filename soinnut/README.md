I was practicing the usage of Rust and I made something for my friend as an exercise (he gave me specs). He found this useful for a musician so I decided to share this.

Enter some sounds (like: C E G) and it will calculate all the chords you may use with these sounds (Included: major, minor, dom7, min7, maj7, 6). This is very powerful especially combined with skaalat.exe since you may just copy-paste the scale that is harmonic with your sounds from skaalat.exe and you will find not only find hamonic scales for your melody from Skaalat, but also some chords that are "quite" hamonic with your scale. This should speed up your learning how to compose music especially in the beginning! The used sounds are in this form: C, C#, D, D#, E, E#, F, F#, G, G#, A, Bb, B.
