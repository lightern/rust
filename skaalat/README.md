## Skaalat

I was practicing the usage of Rust and I made something for my friend as an exercise (he gave me specs). He found this useful for a musician so I decided to share this.

Enter some sounds (like: C E G) and it will calculate how many times those sounds can be found from every basic 7 sound scale and mod. The used sounds are in this form: C, C#, D, D#, E, E#, F, F#, G, G#, A, Bb, B.
