# Some Rust based programs:



In case you want to compile these programs yourself, you will find the source codes from the root folder.


## Skaalat

Enter some sounds (like: C E G) and it will calculate how many times those sounds can be found from every basic 7 sound scale and mod.


## Soinnut

Enter some sounds (like: C E G) and it will calculate all the chords you may use with these sounds (Included: major, minor, dom7, min7, maj7, 6). This is very powerful especially combined with skaalat.exe since you may just copy-paste the scale that is harmonic with your sounds from skaalat.exe and you will find not only find hamonic scales for your melody from Skaalat, but also some chords that are "quite" hamonic with your scale. This should speed up your learning how to compose music especially in the beginning!
