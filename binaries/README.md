# Some Rust based programs:

If you want to compile these programs yourself, you will find source codes from root folder.

## Skaalat

Enter some sounds (like: C E G) and it will calculate how many times those sounds can be found from every basic 7 sound scale and mod.

## Soinnut

Enter some sounds (like: C E G) and it will calculate all the chords you may use with these sounds (Included: major, minor, dom7, min7, maj7, 6). This is very powerful especially combined with skaalat.exe since you may copy-paste the scales that are harmonic with your sounds from skaalat.exe and you will find some chords that are "quite" hamonic with your sounds. This should speed up your learning how to compose music!
